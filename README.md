__GeoAssist__ is the ultimate GeoGuessr battle royale tool that will give you answers instantly! GeoAssist works for both Country Battle and Distance Battle.

# Getting Started

### Usage

[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://github.com/jj0e/geoassist/releases/tag/v1.0)

GeoAssist is extremley user-friendly. To get started, simply join a game of battle royale. Once you join a lobby, look in the url bar of your browser. You will see a unique identifier known as a [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). Copy + paste this into GeoAssist.

##### Example of URL which contains uuid
```
https://www.geoguessr.com/battle-royale/c09a6b49-9878-4d80-9380-c6b274d94768
```
The uuid to paste would be `c09a6b49-9878-4d80-9380-c6b274d94768`

Sit back and relax! GeoAssist will start watching the game and give you the answer as soon as the round loads!

#### Note: GeoAssist will cause you to lose interest in the game. We recommend only using it for educational purposes.
